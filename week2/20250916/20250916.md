# CSS Specificity, the Cascade Algorithm, and Inheritance
# 1. What Is CSS Specificity, and the Specificity for Inline, Internal, and External CSS?
- CSS specificity: It's concept that determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules could apply.
- Style attribute,  which is applied directly to an element, has highest specificity,
- Following this, ID selectors like #main and #header have a high level of specificity.
- Next, class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes come into play.
- Examples include class selectors such as .container and .button, attribute selectors like [type ="text"], and pseudo-classes such as :hover. These have a moderate level of specificity.
- Type selectors, such as div and h1, and pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after, have a lower specificity compared to the previous groups.
- * has the lowest specificity of all.

# 3. What Is the Universal Selector, and what Is Its Specificity?
- * is a special type of CSS selector that matches any element in the document. 
- * {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
 This set the margin and padding for the entire HTML document.
