## 1. What Is the @font-face At-Rule, and How Does It Work?
- You can define a custom font by specifying the font file, format, and other important properties,like wight and style.
- Basic syntax
 @font-face {
  font-family: "MyCustomFont";
    }
- You also need to specify the src. This contains references to the font resources. 
- @font-face {
  font-family: "MyCustomFont"; 
  src: url("path/to/font.woff2"),
    url("path/to/font.woff"),
    url("path/to/font.otf");
    }
 In the above, we are including the font files.
- You can also specify the format. This is optional. It's a hint for the browser on the font format.
- Possible font formats include collection, embedded-opentype, opentype, svg, truetype, woff, and woff2
- @font-face {
  font-family: "MyCustomFont"; 
  src: url("path/to/font.woff2") format("woff2"),
    url("path/to/font.otf") format("opentype"),
    url("path/to/font.woff") format("woff");
    }
## 2. How Do You Work with External Fonts Like Font Squirrel and Google Fonts?
- An external font is a font file that is not included directly withing your project files. They're usually hosted on a separate server. 
- You can use external fonts by using a link element or @importn. 
- <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
- @import 
    url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2? family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap');
- Set the fallback font when you are using customized fonts.

## 2. What Is the text-shadow Property, and How Does It Work?
- You can use the text-shadow property to add shadows.
- You need to specify x offset, y offset, blur radius, and color.
- Text can have more than one shadow, separated by comma.
- p {
  text-shadow: 
    3px 2px 3px #00ffc3, 
    -3px -2px 3px #0077ff, 
    5px 4px 3px #dee7e5;
    }
- letter-spacing property can be used to adjust the space between each character of text in an element.
- :no(#example) pseudo-class: It excludes the elements that don't match with the id or class.
- text-indent property.

# Best Practices for Accessibility and CSS
## 1. What Are Some Tools to check for Good Color Contrast on Site?
- Color contrast is crucial for accessibility and readability.
- To use WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker, simply visit their website and enter the hexadecimal codes for your foreground and background colors. The tool will then calculate the contrast ratio and indicate whether it meets the WCAG 2.0 level AA or AAA standards. 
- Another valuable tool is the TPGi Colour Contrast Analyzer. 
## 2. What Are Some Best Practices for Hiding Content So It Doesn't Become Inaccessible?
- Hiding content on a webpage is a common practice in web development, but it's crucial to do it in a way that doesn't compromise accessibility. 
- display : none; is common hiding tool.
    It removes it from the accessivility tree too. So assisitive technology users won't be able to access this content.
- visibility: hidden;
    It hides the content visually but keeps it in the document flow. It also removes removes content from accessibility tree. 
- .sr-only : It is used to show the contents to screen readers only.
- max function : max(,) : It returns the largest value of a set of comma-separated values.i
- role attribute : It can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. 
    ex : role="region";
- Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. 
- One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute.
# Understanding How to Work with Floats and Positioning in CSS
## 1. What Are Common Use Cases for Using Floats, and How Do They Work?
- When an element is floated, it's taken out of the normal document flow and pushed to the left or right of its container.
- The content that follows will wrap around the floated element, filling the remaining space. 
- image{
    float: left;
}
## 2. What Is Relative Positioning, and How Does This Differ from the Default Static Positioning?
- By default, elements are statically positioned.
- .relative {
      position: relative;
      top: 30px;
      left: 30px;
    }
    The paragraph will apppear 30px down and 30px to the right from its original position.
## 3. What Is Absolute Positioning, and How Does It Work?
- Absolute positioning allows you to take an element out of the normal document flow, making it behave independently from other elements. 
- When an element is positioned absolutely, it is placed in its own layer, completely separate from everything else in the layout. 
- This makes it useful for creating floating UI features such as modals, tooltips, or dropdown menus, which can overlap other elements on the page.
- You can move the absolutely positioned element around using the top, bottom, left, and right properties to specify how far away it should be from the edges of its containing element.
- .positioned {
  position: absolute;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
  background-color: coral;
}
## 4. What Is Fixed and Sticky Positioning, and How Does It Differ from Absolute Positioning?
- When an element is positioned with position: fixed, it is removed from the normal document flow and placed relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same position even when the user scrolls. 
- This is often used for elements like headers or navigation bars that need to remain visible at all times. 
- h1 {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 500px;
  background: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
- position: sticky behaves as a hybrid between relative and fixed positioning.
- Initially, the element behaves as though it's positioned relatively, staying within the flow of the document.
- However, once the user scrolls the element past a certain point, it "sticks" to the viewport (usually the top) and behaves as though it is fixed. 
- .positioned {
  position: sticky;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
}
## 5. What Is the Z-Index Property, and How Does It Work to Control the Stacking of Positioned Elements?
- The z-index property in CSS is used to control the vertical stacking order of positioned elements that overlap on the page. 
- the z-index value determines which element appears on top. 
- The higher the z-index value, the closer the element is to the viewer.
-  the z-index only works on elements that are positioned, which means the element must have a position value other than static.
