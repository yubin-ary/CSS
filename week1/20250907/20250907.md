# Understanding Computer, Internet, and Tooling Basics.
#
# 1. What Are the Basic Parts of a Computer?
- As a developer, it is  important to understand the basic inner workings of a computer.
- Motherboard : It holds all the memory and connectors that are needed to run the computer. It serves as the main circuit board for the computer.
- CPU : CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. CPU is a processor that is responsible for exexcuting instructions and performing clalculations. 
- RAM :  RAM is a componenent about computer's short term memory. RAM stands for Random Access Memory.
- HDD : Hard Disk Drive is a permanent storage.
- SSD : Solid State Drive is non volatile flash memory and can be used in place of a hard drive. SSDs are faster and smaller than hard drives but hard drives are cheaper and have more storage capacity.

#
# 2. What Are the Different Types of Tools Professional Developers Use?
- IDE : It stands for Intergrated development environment. IDEs like visual studio, Jetbrains, and pycharm proviede powerful features lke comde completion, debugging,and integrated terminal support.
- Version Control System: When you wirte code with code editors and IDEs, you need to track the changes you make to them. Git is the most widely used version control system in the development community.
- Package manager : It helps developers simpliify the process of adding, updating, and removing libraries and project dependencies. Examples of poopuler package managers are : NPM, PIP, Composer...

# What Is CSS?
#
# 1. What Is CSS, and What Is Its Role on the Web?
- CSS : CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It makes HTML looks good.
- You can control layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages without altering the HTML structure.
#
#
# 2. What Is the Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule?
- CSS rule is made up of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block.
-   selector {
    property: value;
    }
- A selector is a pattern used in CSS to identify and target specific HTML elements for styling.
- The curly braces provided in the basic syntax ard known as a declaration block. A declaration block applies a set of styles for a given selector, or selectors.
- Inside the declaration block, you will have a series of declarations. Each declaration consists of a property and a value.
- If you want to alpply the same set of styles to multiple selectors, you can create a selector list with each selector separated by a comma.
- #title,
.subheading {
  color: navy;
}
- It adds blue color to element which with the id of title and subheading.
- id selector starts with # and class selector starts with a dot.
#
#
# 3. What Is the Meta Viewport Element Used For?
- It decides how to control the web's scaling and demension in different devices.
- content="width=device-width" : It tells the browser to set the width of the page to match the screen width of the device.
- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
- initial-scale=1.0 : It sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. 1.0 means that the page is displayed at 100% at zoom.
- viewport : It ensures that your webpages are displayed properly in mobile devices.
- user-scalabel=no : It disables zooming.
#
#
# 4. What Are Some Defaoul Browser Styles Applied to HTML?
- We call style which exists before we add the style with CSS, a default browser. For example, h1 to h6.
- <hr> : It creates a horizontal rule.
- <blockquote> : It is used to indicate a section of text that is a quotation from another source.
- <a> : It is defaultly styled with blue color. You can see links in a webpage that is colored blue, underlined. 
- <ul>, <ol> : When we use them, they automatically add bullets or numberings.
#
#
# 5. What Are Inline, Internal, and External CSS, and When Should You Use Each One?
- Inline CSS : Inline CSS is written directly within an HTML element using the style attribute.
- example of using inline CSS
    <p style="color: red;">This is an inline-styled paragraph.</p>
 We are using style attribute to set the text color red.
- It should be avoided becaouse it can clutter the HTML and make the code harder to maintain.
- Internal CSS : Internal CSS is writtem within the style tags inside the head section of an HTML.
- example of using internal CSS
    <head>
    <style>
        p {
        color: blue;
        }
    </style>
    </head>
    <body>
    <p>This paragraph is styled using internal CSS.</p>
    </body>
 the internal CSS applies blue text to all p elements on the page.
- Internal CSS is best used when you need to apply styles to a specific page rather than across multiple pages. 
- downsides : It is not reusable across multiple pages.
- External CSS : It is written separately with .css file linked to the HTML document. It allows you to style miltiple pages consistently and is the preferred method in professional web development.
- example of using external CSS 
 <head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>This paragraph is styled using external CSS.</p>
</body>
 link element jas a rel attribute that specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource, such as linking to a stylesheet or and external resource.

#
# 6. How Do Width and Height Work?
- Width and Height properties are used to control the dimensions of elements on a webpage.
- These can be defined in different units such as pixels(px), percentages(%), viewport units(vw, vh) and more.
- the width properth specifieds the width of and element. If you don't specify a width, then the default is set to auto. It means full width.
- If you don't set the height, it will adjust to the content inside.
- min-width, min-height : You can set the minimum value of them.
- max-width, max-height : You can set the maximum value of them.
- CSS prioritizes min-width and min-height over width and height.
#
#
# 7. What Are the Different Types of CSS Combinators?
- CSS combinators are sused to define the relationship between selectors in CSS. They help in selecting elements based on their relationship to other elements, which allows for more precise and efficient styling.
- Descendant combinator : It is used to target elements matched by the second selector if they are nested within an ancestor element that matches the first selector.
- figure img {
  border: 4px solid black;
}
 select all img elements in the figure element.

- there is blank between the parent and child selector.
- Child combinator(>) : It is used to select elements that are direct children of a specified parent element. This combinaotr targets only elements with a specific parent, making your CSS rules more precise and preventing unintended styling of deeper nested elements.
- example 
<div class="container">
    <p>First</p>
    <div>
      <p>Second</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Third</p>
    </div>
</div>

- In the above, the container class is added to div element. And there's one paraghaph element that is direct child of container class. Other paragraphs are nested in deeper location.
- To apply styles to just the direct child of the container class, you can use the child combinator like this : 
    .container > p {
        color : blue;
    }
- THe next-sibling conbinator(+) in CSS selects an element that immediately follows a specified sibling element. 
<figure>
  <img
    src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
    alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
  />
  <figcaption>A cute orange cat lying on its back.</figcaption>
</figure>

- img + figcaption {
    border: 4px solid balck;
}
- In this case, the next-sibling combinator(+) selects the figcaption element that immediately follows the img element. the applied CSS rule adds a 4px solid black border around the figcaption.
- Subsequent-sibling combinator(~) : It selects all siblings of a specofied element that come after it. 
<div class="container">
  <h2>Subheading</h2>
  <p>First paragraph.</p>
  <p>Second paragraph.</p>
  <p>Third paragraph.</p>
  <p>Another paragraph element</p>
</div>

- h2 ~ p {
  color: green;
}
- In this case, all paragraph elements following the h2 element will have text color green.

# 8. What Is the Difference Between Inline and Block-Level Elements in CSS?
- display: block; - Always start new line from the start. Useful when you want to display contents vertical. It's default setting.
- Common block element : div
- display: inline; - Inline elements have this property by default. This ensures that element remains within the flow of the content and does not break onto a new line. Simply, they doesn't have an effect on layouts or contexts.
- Common inline elements : span, anchor, and img.
#
#
# 9. How Does Inline-Block Work, and How Does It Differ from Inline and Block Elements?
- inline-block : It is a hybrid element of block and inline element.
- Like inline elements, inline-block elements remain in the text flow without starting on a new line.
- Unlike inline elements, you can adjust the width and height of an inline-block element, just as you would with block-level elements.
- Simply, you can control a size of inline-block element. 
- .inline-block-element {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 150px;
  height: 100px;
 }
 You should write display: inline-block; or neither the height nor the width will be alpplied.
